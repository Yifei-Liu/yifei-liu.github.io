Yet even mature file systems suffer repeated bugs. File system bugs have serious consequences such as data loss and system crashes. To address these challenges, we developed MCFS, a model-checking framework to detect file system bugs/defects and facilitate file system development. We used Spin model checker to perform state-space exploration that needs to save/restore file system state. Therefore, we developed two in-memory file systems, VeriFS1 and VeriFS2, with checkpoint/restore API to capture and restore the full file system state via ioctl. MCFS found real bugs while we were developing VeriFS.\nMy role: I joined this project in Jun. 2020 and is now leading this project since Sep. 2021.

Combining different devices, write policies, and cache replacement policies causes vast space of multi-tier caching configurations. Particularly, users hope to gain better performance with lower purchase costs for the devices. Still, the enormous configurable space makes finding the optimal configuration impractical by evaluating all the possible configurations. Therefore, we managed to apply point selection to detect valuable \u0026ldquo;key points\u0026rdquo; in the Miss ratio curves (MRCs). After experimenting with several existing point selection methods, we proposed our novel point selection technique that outperforms the existing methods and can efficiently and accurately identify the best multi-tier caching configuration regarding cost vs. performance efficiently and accurately.\nMy role: I joined this project in Jan. 2020 and am still part of this project currently.
