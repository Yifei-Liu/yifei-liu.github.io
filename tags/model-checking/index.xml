      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developing and maintaining a file system is time-consuming and complex. Yet even mature
file systems suffer repeated bugs. File system bugs have serious consequences
such as data loss and system crashes. To address these challenges, we developed MCFS,
a model-checking framework to detect file system bugs/defects and
facilitate file system development. We used Spin model checker to perform
state-space exploration that needs to save/restore file system state. Therefore, we
developed two in-memory file systems, VeriFS1 and VeriFS2, with checkpoint/restore
API to capture and restore the full file system state via ioctl. MCFS
found real bugs while we were developing VeriFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I joined this project in Jun. 2020 and is now leading this project since Sep. 2021. My labmate previously led this project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
