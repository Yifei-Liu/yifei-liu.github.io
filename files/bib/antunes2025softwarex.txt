  ABSTRACT =	 {Identifying knee and elbow points in performance curves is
                  a critical task in various domains, including machine
                  learning and system design. These points represent optimal
                  trade-offs between cost and performance, facilitating
                  efficient decision-making and resource
                  allocation. However, accurately determining the knees and
                  elbows in curves poses a significant challenge. To address
                  this challenge, we introduce Kneeliverse , an open-source
                  library dedicated to knee/elbow point
                  detection. Kneeliverse incorporates a suite of
                  well-established knee-detection algorithms, including
                  Menger, L-method, Kneedle, and DFDT. Additionally,
                  Kneeliverse extends these algorithms to detect multiple
                  knees and elbows in complex curves, employing a recursive
                  approach. Kneeliverse further includes Z-Method, a
                  recently developed algorithm specifically designed for
                  multi-knee detection.},
