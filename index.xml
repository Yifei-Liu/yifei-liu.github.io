      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developing and maintaining a file system is time-consuming and complex. Yet even mature
file systems suffer repeated bugs. File system bugs have serious consequences
such as data loss and system crashes. To address these challenges, we developed MCFS,
a model-checking framework to detect file system bugs/defects and
facilitate file system development. We used Spin model checker to perform
state-space exploration that needs to save/restore file system state. Therefore, we
developed two in-memory file systems, VeriFS1 and VeriFS2, with checkpoint/restore
API to capture and restore the full file system state via ioctl. MCFS
found real bugs while we were developing VeriFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I joined this project in Jun. 2020 and is now leading this project since Sep. 2021. My labmate previously led this project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-tier Caching</title>
      <link>/project/mtcache-proj/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Relying on modern storage devices, multi-tier caching has been broadly employed in cloud storage and data centers. Combining different devices, write policies, and cache replacement policies causes vast space of multi-tier caching configurations. Particularly, users hope to gain better performance with lower purchase costs for the devices. Still, the enormous configurable space makes finding the optimal configuration impractical by evaluating all the possible configurations. Therefore, we managed to apply point selection to detect valuable &amp;ldquo;key points&amp;rdquo; in the Miss ratio curves (MRCs). After experimenting with several existing point selection methods, we proposed our novel point selection technique that outperforms the existing methods and can efficiently and accurately identify the best multi-tier caching configuration regarding cost vs. performance efficiently and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I joined this project in Jan. 2020 and am still part of this project currently. My labmate leads this project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Existing storage systems apply simple metadata and hierarchical directory trees, which fail to meet the requirements of content-based queries (i.e., semantic queries) like finding semantically similar images with one specific image file. Therefore, we designed and implemented SwiftGraph, a system middleware that supported semantic metadata generated from deep learning hash. SwiftGraph applied an effective graph structure to organize the semantic hash code and provided fast content-based query interfaces. The performance evaluation on the different datasets demonstrated that the query precision and efficiency of SwiftGraph outran other searchable metadata paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I was the first leader of the SwiftGraph project and completed most of the work for the system. Finally, thanks to my collaborators and mentors, the extended version of SwiftGraph, CSS, was accepted to DAC&#39;20.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark data are some existing data that the developers or users are unaware of their existence or value, or do not know how to extract value from them. To address the emerging dark data challenge, we proposed a framework for assessing the value of image dark data by using a novel semantic hash ranking (SHR) algorithm. This framework ranked the value of the image dark data, and therefore it helped discover &amp;ldquo;important images&amp;rdquo; in the massive image dataset. The evaluation results had demonstrated the performance and validity of our methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I wrote part of the code to implement the SHR algorithm and evaluate SHR by comparing different relevant techniques. This project had a strong relationship with the SwiftGraph project I led.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disk Failure Prediction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the observation from Microsoft Research (Vishwanath &amp;amp; Nagappan, 2010), disk failures accounted for a majority (78%) of replacements/faults in datacenters. In this project, we built an infrastructure to collect the long-term S.M.A.R.T. data of HDDs from over 10,000 servers in Tencent data centers and monitor disk health in real-time. The historical disk failures constituted positive samples for disk failure prediction. We applied several machine learning algorithms to train the prediction model. Our experiments indicated that our model achieved both high precision and high recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I participated in creating the data collection system in Tencent cloud and experimented with various machine learning algorithms for disk failure prediction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recommend the atomic service and a set of services with correlations for meeting users&amp;rsquo; QoS requirements in the era of service-oriented computing. To effectively organize and recommend web services, we used three-stage Bayesian network structure learning to construct a directed acyclic graph (network) and parameter learning to learn the conditional probability of all the nodes in the network. Compared to other service recommendation methods, the Bayesian network is more suitable for correlated services. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate and illustrate the functionalities and advantages of our proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I worked on the experiments of Bayesian Network Reasoning for web service recommendation and had tested different sampling (e.g., Gibbs sampling, MCMC) and inference (e.g., variable elimination, junction tree) algorithms for Bayesian network together with various searching methods (e.g., greedy search, hill climbing, and K2 algorithm).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Line Segment Detection for Rapeseed Plant Images</title>
      <link>/project/automeasure-proj/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Character parameters of crops like plant height and branch length are important to production and mechanized harvest. We proposed a methodology that detects line segments in the plant images to measure rapeseed plants&amp;rsquo; character parameters automatically. Our image line detection utilized the Line Segment Detector (Von Gioi et al., 2008), a fast, accurate, and state-of-the-art line detection algorithm. For eliminating the noisy and discontinuous line segments, we applied several techniques based on the geometric features of extracted lines. The experiment shows that the error rate of the results is as low as 1.25% with inexpensive computing resources, which can meet the actual demands of agriculture better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My role: I designed and implemented all the algorithms and experiments for this project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
